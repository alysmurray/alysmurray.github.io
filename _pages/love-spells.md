_Perfect for fans of Hocus Pocus, Halloweentown, and Good Omens, this Halloween romance is certain to put you under its spell...._

Leyton is pretty much your normal town. And I’m pretty much your normal twenty-something. Except that Leyton is populated by magical beings and I’m a witch.

Every year, for the month of October, Leyton opens its doors to the mortal world. They bring their money, their hokey human charm, and…they bring Him.

Elijah Thorne.

Elijah Thorne is a proper thorn in my side. And a witch-hunter who, for some reason, is obsessed with the idea of hunting me. For years, we’ve been playing this game of cat and mouse and for years, I’ve managed to evade him.

But this year…Well, this year I accidentally knitted all of my anxieties into these enchanted scarves I was selling on Etsy, one of them got back to an all-powerful Ancient in the Fairy Dimension, and, as punishment, she's going to bring about the end of the world on Halloween night.

So, the witch hunter and I have to team up with the rest of the town to stop her Which would be easy if I could just, you know, stop falling in love with Eli long enough to finish the job.
