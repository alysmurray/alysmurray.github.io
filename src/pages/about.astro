              My name is <strong class="text-charcoal">Alys Murray</strong> and welcome to my website! Here, you'll find everything there is to find about me: links to my social media pages, information about my books and films, and even a contact form if you would like to get in touch!
            </p>
            <p>
              Born and raised in <strong class="text-charcoal">New Orleans, Louisiana</strong>, I received my BFA from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, where I completed a playwriting Fellowship with NYU London, The Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA), the Jermyn Street Theatre, and the Writers Guild of Great Britain. Subsequently, I received my MFA in Film Studies from Kings College London.

          I am format agnostic - I will write film, television, books, podcasts, anything! - but thematically devout. <strong class="text-charcoal">I love telling stories about love!</strong> As a disabled screenwriter and RespectAbility Fellow, I feel it is both my honor and duty to tell stories that bring joy and hope to audiences everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love swing dancing, romance novels, Brendan Fraser, and screwball comedies of the 1930's and 1940's. Tobey Maguire is my Spider-Man. Michael Bay has two films in the Criterion Collection. I'm an avid cook and baker, and have company over for big meals and parties any chance I get. If you've got a great recipe, please send it my way! I also travel extensively, and have visited nearly 30 countries - any travel tips? I'd love to hear those, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a kid, I was a voracious reader, devouring everything from The Princess Diaries to Great Expectations. Over the years, I started writing my own stories, plays, and fanfiction and developed a love for storytelling. Getting to write professionally is a dream come true, and when you read my books or watch my films, I hope they make you as happy as writing them has made me.
        </p>

          If you ever have any questions, want to chat about my books or just say hello, you can reach me on any of my social media pages or with the <a href={`${base}contact`} class="text-burgundy hover:text-burgundy-dark underline">contact form</a>. I love connecting with readers and hope to hear from you soon!
