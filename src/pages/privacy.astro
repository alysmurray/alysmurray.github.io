        <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl mt-12 mb-6">How Do We Use The Information We Collect?</h2>
        <p class="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:</p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-charcoal-light">
          <li>To personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)</li>
          <li>To improve our website (we continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you)</li>

You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email.

        <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl mt-12 mb-6">How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
        <p class="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">
          We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Alys Murray to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl mt-12 mb-6">How Do We Protect Your Information?</h2>
        <p class="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">
          We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.
        </p>
        <p class="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">
          After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to Alys Murray or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
        </p>

Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl mt-12 mb-6">Is The Information Collected Through The Alys Murray Service Secure?</h2>
        <p class="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">
          We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

        <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl mt-12 mb-6">Information About General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
        <p class="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">
          We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-serif text-xl mt-8 mb-4">What is GDPR?</h3>
        <p class="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">
          GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data. The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers' data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-serif text-xl mt-8 mb-4">What is Personal Data?</h3>
        <p class="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">
          Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person's name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-serif text-xl mt-8 mb-4">The Data Protection Principles</h3>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-charcoal-light">
          <li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
          <li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose.</li>
          <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
          <li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="font-serif text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Why is GDPR Important?</h3>
        <p class="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">
          GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. At Alys Murray we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl mt-12 mb-6">Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</h2>
        <p class="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">
          We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. Alys Murray processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl mt-12 mb-6">California Residents</h2>
        <p class="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">
          The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to disclose categories of Personal Information we collect and how we use it, the categories of sources from whom we collect Personal Information, and the third parties with whom we share it, which we have explained above.
        </p>
        <p class="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">We are also required to communicate information about rights California residents have under California law. You may exercise the following rights:</p>
